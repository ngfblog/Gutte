Convert text written in English according to Hebrew keyboard layout

Hebrew Keyboard Layout Corrector
This tool converts text that was mistakenly typed using English characters (QWERTY layout) when the user intended to type in Hebrew. 
It maps the Latin characters back to their corresponding Hebrew letters based on the standard Hebrew keyboard layout.

Solves: The common problem of typing akuo instead of שלום due to incorrect input language settings.
